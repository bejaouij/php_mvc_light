 # PHP MVC Light
 Very lightweight project containing the basic requirements for an MVC web application behaviour.
 
 ## Deployment
 Here are what you need to start an **MVC Light** project.
 
 ### Dependences
 First, you will need the following tools:
 * The **PHP 7.2+** interpreter (previous versions may suit but were not tested in this project).
 
 ### Get started
 Download the project source files archive from this url:
 ```
 https://github.com/bejaouij/php_mvc_light/archive/master.zip
```
Or by cloning the related repository by typing:
```
git clone https://github.com/bejaouij/php_mvc_light.git
```
Next, copy the **'*database.sample.php*'** in the **'*app/config*'** directory with the name **'*database.php*'** in the same folder. Then, inform the related information to connect your application to your database.
```
cd [path_to_your_project]/app/config
cp database.sample.php database.php
```
I suggest you to not only rename the sample file. By copying it, you keep a backup in the case you lose your configuration.
